        <p id="bio">My hobby is riding a bicycle. I chose this hobby because it keeps the body fit and fine. Riding a bicycle is not a hard activity and we can do it in anywhere. According to me riding a bicycle is good because, it does not waste away many time and is a kind of a good activity. Not only cycling is highly efficient, it is generally of low cost and also you will be exercising while you save money. In addition to the cost savings, cycling as a whole is easy to pick up. Apart from this it will increase your stamina, build muscles, burn calories and give your body added strength. In addition, it's a great way to do some sightseeing and to simply get around town. </p>
